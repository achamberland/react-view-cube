TODO

Top 3:
1) Support adding any React component as a view/face of the cube with a single method [ Like: Cube.addFace(component, options) ]
2) Support more than 4 horizontal sides (while keeeping the 4-sided cube shape look in animations)
3) Speed animation when cube's views are complicated


Environment

1) Set up gulp to build jsx/babel/sass/anything else with one cl command

2) Organize JS into modules


Extensibility/Frameworkiness

1) Allow any react component to plug into the cube as a view.
   Probably like:
     Cube.addFace(component, options);
     Cube.removeFace(component);
     Cube.shiftFace(component, destination);
   
2) Configure icons for nav arrows- allow easy option to avoid loading fontawesome




Functionality

1) Rotate top/bottom to match prev view's top/bottom

2) Shade up/down movement animations

âˆš  3) Use arrow keys to move left/right

4) Make cube work with more than 4 sides (Use feed to test)
