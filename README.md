# react-view-cube
A template for websites without a lot of views, if you're looking for something flashy and subtly 3D-ish.
Each view is a face of a cube. Gimmicky and nice-looking


Future Plans:
- Making this a framework, something that can handle any React component as a view/face of the cube
- Supporting more than 4 horizontal sides to the cube (while still maintaining an illusion of the cube shape)
- General refactor (First project written with React, see todos.txt file)
