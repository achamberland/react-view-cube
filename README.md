# react-view-cube
A template for websites without a lot of views. 3D-ish navigation. Gimmicky and nice-looking


Build
-------
You'll need npm and gulp installed first.
Gulp is used here to make builds from Sass / ES6 / Browserify files.

To build, navigate to the react-cube-view folder in the command line and type:

`gulp`
