# react-view-cube

A template for websites without a lot of views. 3D-ish navigation. nice-looking and gimmicky.


Build
-------
To edit and build you'll need npm and gulp installed first.  
Gulp will make builds from Sass / ES6 / Browserify files.

To build, just navigate to the react-cube-view folder in the command line and type `gulp`


Future Plans
-------
To let any component be added to the cube with a method call like:  
`Cube.addFace( {{Component}}, {{faceIndex}}, {{verticalPos}} );`
